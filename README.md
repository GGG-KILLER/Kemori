Kemori is a manga downloader that I made after using [Hakuneko](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hakuneko/) for a long time (the interface was heavily influenced by it as I couldn't think of anything better than it).

### Why should I use this? ###
* Pluggable connectors (no need for others to compile the whole program or the connector)
* Portability of .NET framework: 1 binary for both Linux (Mono) and Windows (.NET)
* Hability to get past CloudFlare's challenge page (meaning more connectors for more websites)

### How do I get set up? ###
* Visual Studio Community 2015 (with NuGet)
* .NET 4.6
* [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) (Automatically restored by NuGet)

### How do I install? ###
Currently there are no **official** installers, therefore you'll have to download the binary from the Downloads/Releases section and run the binary directly.

### Contribution guidelines ###
* Mantain the code style already being used in the project (including spacing).
* Mantain (or increment) the Object Orientation Programming used in the project. Try to make everything object oriented or at least try not to add something that isn't OO (unless it's not possible) or transform something that is OO to non-OO.
* Only use english
* Comment (documentation comments such as <summary> in functions and classes) **everything**.
